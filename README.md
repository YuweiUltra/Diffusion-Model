# Diffusion-Model

This project is inspired firstly by my course project in an excellent Machine Learning course, where I used a diffusion model to generate images of digits with high similarity to the original data distribution. As a student in financial mathematics, I quickly found that the diffusion idea is not an unfamiliar word to me. It's one of the most useful ideas in pricing derivatives. So I started to search for paperwork that uses diffusion models in quantitative finance.
