# Diffusion-Model

This project is inspired firstly by my course project in an excellent Machine Learning course, where I used a diffusion model to generate images of digits with high similarity to the original data distribution.

As a student in financial mathematics, I quickly found that the diffusion idea is not an unfamiliar word to me. It's one of the most useful ideas in pricing derivatives. So I started to search for paperwork that uses diffusion models in quantitative finance.
And I did find one, [Diffusion Variational Autoencoder for Tackling Stochasticity in Multi-Step Regression Stock Price Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00073), which is really good.

However, before digging into it, it's better for me to have a review of diffusion models to stay abreast of the recent developments in the field\
